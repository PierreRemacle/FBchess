# FBchess
this code allows u to create a Chess game in your messenger discussions

First you need to add your email address and password to the code by changing it at line 689 of the main code "chessFB.py"

then , while it runs you can type "@chess" to see the actual game
                                  "@chess newgame" to create a new game
                                  "@chess A1 A1" to move a piece , this will only work if the move is valid

u can have only have one game per person 

Castling is not implemented and the code dont check if your king is attacked at the moment

will update it later
